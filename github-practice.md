# Github, this course provides a glimpse of what Github is, emphasizing the importance of understanding and practicing its concepts.
# Throughout this ourse, I have drawn a key lesson that highlights how mastering the use of this online interface not only enhances your coding skills but also connects you with a broader community, 
# allowing you to grasp advanced tools and technologies. 
#
# I also learnt about rulesets.
# A ruleset in Gihub is a named list of rules that can be applied to a repository. These help to control interactions with specific branches from several contributers.
# The importance of rulesets is to enable protection of owner's branches by controlling access and actions within a repository, such as who can push commits or delete tags.
# ***Among others***
# However, despite reading through the notes on both Github and Git, I am still unable to draw a difference from the two. I am well aware they are different, 
# but I just can't seem to figure it out,because to me, the description is almost the same.
I was mostly intrigued by the 'Markdown' feature which allows one to format their texts on GitHub, in places like repository READMEs and comments on pull requests.
